# Introduction

The concept of live e-commerce might be very new to people in US, but in China, where live e-commerce market is huge, a good host can generate millions in sales in just a few hours. In fact, by March 2020, the number of live commerce users had reached 265 million, accounting for 29.3% of the country’s total number of internet users, and that was only before COVID-19 hit. 
By deep-diving into the data and reflecting on some trends and patterns that live e-commerce has in China, out group wish to generate an analysis that will be helpful for anyone who is interested in starting steaming commerce business in the US. 
One of the most popular platforms for live commerce in China is called ''Douyin'', the Chinese version of Tiktok with more features available. There is a website called "Chanmama" (https://www.chanmama.com/) that collects and distributes data about live commerce happening on Douyin. Based on data fetched from the website, we will focus our study on how hosts, products, live streaming timing, and related short-videos impact the total revenue generated from the live e-commerce. Although everyone is able to sell products on Douyin, most revenues are generated by hosts who are either celebrities or key opinion leaders (KOLs). In our analysis, celebrities are defined as famous singers/actors/actresses in China who are known by the public before starting the live streaming sales and KOLs are hosts who are known as a result of live-streaming sales or publishing short videos on Douyin. The difference between those two groups is compared throughout our project and we will mainly study the top 20 hosts ranked by revenue generated.

# Data sources

Our dataset is collected from a website called “Chanmama" (https://www.chanmama.com/), which is the largest database that collects and distributes data about live stream e-commerce taking place in the Chinese version of TikTok “Douyin”. It provides data that includes some general information of the live hosts, the detailed revenue of each live stream, and information on the products sold during each live stream. However, since this database currently only covers data about the Chinese version of TikTok, it is only available in Chinese, which means some additional translations are required. Also, we had to register and subscribe first to gain access to the data.

The raw data is in Excel format, and it is located under each live host’s profile. Each live host has three own Excel files storing the data focusing on three different areas, and we can only download the files one by one instead of in just one step. We take advantage of the sales revenue ranking system provided by the database to see who the Top 20 live hosts in terms of sales revenue during June, July, and August of 2021 are. Then, we manually download the data files from these 20 live host profiles and then combine them into three single Excel files. 

The first Excel file is named as Data_Livestream_General, and it includes some general information about each past live stream of the hosts. To help our analysis, we decide to add 3 additional columns to the dataset, including the host’s full name (Name), whether is an online KOL or celebrity (Host_category), and the host’s previous occupation (Occupation). This information is more categorical and available in each host’s profile, but the raw data doesn’t contain it. After the adjustment, there are a total of 21 variables and 20000 more observations in this dataset, but we use them selectively. These variables mainly are numeric data, such as the start time of live steam, the number of products presented, the number of goods sold, total sales amount, duration, views, and the average length of stay. It also includes a few character data such as the name of the live stream, the host’s name, and the occupation.

The second Excel file is named as Data_Sales, and it includes some more detailed information about the specific goods sold by the 20 hosts. Again, to help our analysis, we add the host’s full name as an additional identifier column. After the adjustment, there are a total of 9 variables and more than 10000 observations. These variables include two categorical data, the goods category, and the host’s name. The rest five variables are all numeric data, including a specific good’s retailing price in the Chinese Yuan, its commission rate, sales volume. sales amount, conversion rate, the number of appearances on short videos, and the number of appearances on live streaming.

The third Excel file is named as Data_Short_Videos, and it gives us information about the top 20 hosts' data regarding their posted short videos. It includes a total of 9 variables and 18051 observations in total. Just like in the previous data file, we added in an additional identifier column (name) to the original raw data.This data set tells us information such as Video content release time, the video duration, estimated Sales volume (pieces)	estimated sales amount, Number of likes,	Number of comments, Number of reposts	Name.

# Data transformation
After we gathered the data, we started our data cleaning to make it more convenient for us to work with the data in R. The first thing we did is that we user Python to convert the time variable. The script in Python can be found in our github folder at https://github.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/blob/main/assignmentand%20data/data%20processing/transfer%20duration%20to%20seconds.ipynb. This was necessary because we had time data in digit plus time unit in English format, and it is in different units including hour, minute and second. Thus, we matched the English character with different unit of time and converted all time variable into the number of seconds. We did the conversion to the duration of the live stream, the average duration per viewer in the Data_Livestream_general.xlsx and the video duration in Data_Short_Videos.xlsx.

We also changed the Host_category variable from F/T to K/C, as in K standing for KOL and C standing for celebrities. This change could make our later visualization clearer. For the category of items, we had a look at the over twenties different categories and eventually combined them into nine general categories. To further organized our data, we removed the Chinese title of each session of live stream and assign an unique id to each session. 

Finally, we also did some final data transformation in R. This includes changing char variable to numeric, changing Name variable into factor and reordering the Name variable by the total revenue each host generated. 

Besides the transformation mentioned above, for our interative component, we also processed our data in Python (code at https://github.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/blob/main/processed%20data/Make%20cumulative%20data.ipynb). We grouped the revenue by each host and date, and got the cumulative sum by each host. We also printed it out in a specfic way so that it fits into the js data format.

# Missing values

We found there are very interesting patterns in the missing values of "Data_Livestream_General_processed.xlsx". Here is the image we get for all of the missing patterns:
![Missing Pattern in our file](pics/Missing Patterns.png)
For our purpose of showcasing the missing pattern, we shortened all the column name so that they would not overlap with our function. 

It is noticeable to us that the most common missing pattern is to have Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing. While this pattern is the most frequent among all the missing patterns, the case where only Per_customer_transaction and Sales_conversion_value_ratio are missing is almost at the same missing frequency.
With this information, we did some exploration to see what are the difference between rows that have valid Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value and those rows that are missing Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio. We first looked at the livestram host to see if that column is related to our missing value. 
![Missing Pattern with respect to hosts](pics/missing pattern with hosts.png)
This image shows the distribution of hosts, with valid Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value (on the left) or not (on the right). We can see that compared to data of other hosts, data for Liu Fang Posture Corrector have a much larger of probability of Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio value being null. When we compared the distribution of hosts when consider whether Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing are missing, the difference in host distribution is not so significant (see image below). 
![Missing Pattern with respect to hosts when considering gd, pr and re](pics/missing patterns with hosts not significance.png)

Thus the frequent missing pattern where Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio are missing is related to this host Liu Fang Posture Corrector. After we took a closer look, we found Liu Fang Posture Corrector would host a livestream for a long duration without selling any item. In this case, Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio values are null while Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are mostly 0. 

We then looked at the case where all Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are missing and compared the duration of the livestream when Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount are missing. 
![Missing Pattern with respect to duration](pics/missing pattern with respect to duration.png)
Here we found that the data with Per_customer_transaction, Sales_conversion_value_ratio, Number_of_goods_sold, Number_of_products and Total_sales_amount missing usually come with low livestream duration. After carefully examination, we found such rows should be the cases when the hosts only stream briefly for testing. 

Similar cases exist when we explore the rows with Average_length_of_stay missing. 
![LS Missing Pattern with respect to duration](pics/missing pattern with duration ls missing.png)

We should also note that these null values shall not be an obstacle to our project as these values are here because they hosts are not selling items or they are selling too few items. The only variable that is missing and is related to our analysis is the Total_sales_amount. For the purpose of our analysis, we will mostly sum the sales amount of live steams in each day together to get the daily revenue, we can drop these rows with missing re during our later process.

## Do celebrities have an advantage over KOLs in live streaming sales?

From 2021/06 to 2021/08, among top20 hosts, KOL generated more revenue than celebrities.

Do celebrities have an advantage over KOLs (key opinion leader)? In particular, what’s the revenue comparison between the two groups? 

We have a hypothesis that people come to celebrities’ live streaming rooms because they like the person and come to KOLs’ live streaming rooms because KOLs offer a higher discount or have expertise in the specific area. 
We will focus on the top 20 hosts’ sales data in the past quarter to answer the questions. We will first define people to be celebrities if they are famous actors/actresses/singers based on our common judgments. Then we will look at their sales data in different categories and test our hypothesis.

### Overview of the sale revenue distribution per day

```{r, echo=FALSE}
livestream <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/main/processed%20data/Data_Livestream_General_processed.csv")
#livestream

#change date
livestream$Date <- as.Date(livestream$Date,format='%m/%d/%y')
livestream$Host_category<-as.factor(livestream$Host_category)


#group revenue by day, host
total_by_day<-livestream %>% group_by(Name, Host_category, Date) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Sales_amount_total = sum(Total_sales_amount,na.rm=TRUE),n=n()) %>%
  ungroup()

average<-total_by_day %>% group_by(Name, Host_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Sales_amount_avg = mean(Sales_amount_total,na.rm=TRUE))  
  
total<-total_by_day %>% group_by(Name, Host_category) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Sales_amount_total = sum(Sales_amount_total,na.rm=TRUE),n=n()) %>%
  left_join(average, by=c("Name", "Host_category"))
```

```{r}
#sales distribution: KOLs host more streaming than c; KOLs sell more than c
ggplot(total_by_day, aes(Sales_amount_total/1000000)) +
geom_histogram()+ 
ggtitle("Counts versus Sale Revenue per Day")+
facet_wrap(~Host_category)+
xlab("Sale Revenue per Day (in millions CNY)")+
scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```

This graph gives an overview of the sale revenue distribution per day. We can see from the graph that daily revenue distribution is right skewed for both celebrities and KOLs. Most daily sales from June 2021 to August 2021 were less than 20 million Chinese Yuan (~3.2m US dollars). Both celebrities and KOLs had generated sales that were more than 50m yuan with celebrities having more positive outliers than KOLs.

We can also see from the graph that KOLs held more livestream than celebrities within the three month. When exploring the data, we found that some host held more than 1 livestream per day. With further investigation, we found there were three scenarios: 1) Some hosts experienced technical issues so they had to end current session and start another session; 2) Some hosts ended the session for lunch/dinner break and restart a new one; 3) Some hosts first started a session without selling goods and then switched to a new session to sell. Therefore, we decided to group sessions that happened in the same day together and track daily performance. The following graph shows number of days they host a livestream from June to August. 

### Total number of days steaming: KOLs host more streaming than celebrities
```{r}
#total number of days steaming: KOLs host more streaming than c
ggplot(total_by_day, aes(fct_infreq(Name), fill=Host_category)) +
geom_bar()+
ggtitle("Number of Days with Livestream versus Host Name")+
xlab("Host Name")+
ylab("Number of Days with Livestream")+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

From the graph, we see that Liu Fang, Luo yonghao, and Liuyuanyuan almost held sessions every day.It is clear that KOLs are broadcasting more frequently than celebrities, which is reasonable since most KOLs were broadcasting for their own products (ex. Liu Fang and Liu Yuanyuan) and other KOLs usually signed contracts with companies and thus had a minimal number of days they need to broadcast. Celebrities, on the other hand, had other jobs to do so they didn't broadcasting as frequently. Luo Yonghao is an outlier in the celebrities group: he was first known by the public as an entrepreneur and actor but now he changed his focus to livestream sales. 

### Relationship between days of livestream and revenue

Now, let's look at the relationship between days of livestream and revenue. 

```{r}
#total sales vs days of streaming: KOLs generate more revenue, Luo is an outlier
ggplot(total, aes(n, Sales_amount_total/1000000, color=Host_category)) +
geom_point()+
ggtitle("Total Sales in 3 Months versus Number of Days with Livestream")+
geom_label_repel(aes(label = Name), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0, max.overlaps = 9, show.legend=FALSE)+
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
xlab("Number of Days with Livestream")+
ylab("Total Sales in 3 Month (in millions CNY)")
```

The graph shows KOLs generated more revenues than celebrities overall. Again, Luo Yonghao is an outlier among these top 20 hosts with much more revenue generated. Actually, he is the most successful host in Douyin. Now, let's explore the revenue difference between the two groups further and look at the average revenue per day. 

```{r}
#avg sales vs days of streaming
ggplot(total, aes(n, Sales_amount_avg/1000000, color=Host_category)) +
geom_point()+
ggtitle("Daily Average Sales versus Number of Days with Livestream")+
geom_label_repel(aes(label = Name), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0, max.overlaps = 9, show.legend=FALSE)+
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
xlab("Number of Days with Livestream")+
ylab("Daily Average Sales (in millions CNY)")
```

Here, we found another outlier Jia Nailiang, who has very large daily sales and only held a couple sessions. After some research, we found that he just started livesteam sales in mid-Aug and only had two days of broadcasting. Usually, when a celebrity just started to sell goods, he/she would get very good discounts from the business so the price were really attractive to consumers. Fans would also buy a lot to support them. Therefore, for our analysis, we will view Jia Nailiang as an outlier and we will keep track of his future performance and see if his data regression to the mean.  

```{r}
#after removing Jia: in general, celebrities hold less streaming and have more avg
total%>%filter(Name!='Jia Nailiang') %>%
ggplot(aes(n, Sales_amount_avg/1000000, color=Host_category)) +
geom_point()+
ggtitle("Daily Average Sales versus Number of Days with Livestream: After removing")+
geom_label_repel(aes(label = Name), size = 2, min.segment.length = 0, max.overlaps = 9, show.legend=FALSE)+
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
xlab("Number of Days with Livestream")+
ylab("Daily Average Sales (in millions CNY)")
```

After removing Jia Nailiang, it's easier to see most celebrities held less than 20 session in the 3 months but they were able to generate more daily revenues. Qi Wei,Lou Yixiao, Zhang Ting, and Zhu Zixiao are famous actresses and they had decent average sales. Another interesting insights we got from the graph is that KOLs were clustered as two groups: a group with large number of livestreams but lower average sales and the other group with fewer livestreams but more average sales. Just looking from the host name, we think it's probably a result of product mix. For example, Mr.Dong Jewely had most average sale among the 19 hosts; from his name, he was probably selling mostly jewely whose unit price is high and consumers don't buy that frequently. 

### Overview of the product mix

We will look more into the product mix in the next section.

Seven categories of products are the following:

```{r}
#by categories
sales <-read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meganzhou62/tiktok_livesale/main/processed%20data/Data_Sales_processed2.csv")
#sales
#sum(is.na(sales))

#factor relevel
sales$Name<-as.factor(sales$Name)
name_order<-fct_reorder(total$Name,-total$Sales_amount_total)%>%levels()
sales$Name<-fct_relevel(sales$Name,name_order)
#levels(sales$Name)


sales$Good_category_new<-as.factor(sales$Good_category_new)
sales_total<-sales %>% group_by(Good_category_new) %>%
  summarize(Sales_volume_total = sum(Sales_volume), Sales_amount_total = sum(Sales_amount))
good_order<-fct_reorder(sales_total$Good_category_new, -sales_total$Sales_amount_total)%>%levels()
sales$Good_category_new<-fct_relevel(sales$Good_category_new,good_order)
levels(sales$Good_category_new)

#aggregate ccategory total
sales2<-sales %>% group_by(Name,Host_category, Good_category_new) %>%
  summarize(Sales_volume_total = sum(Sales_volume), Sales_amount_total = sum(Sales_amount))


```

```{r}
#revenue by host, good category, not clear info
ggplot(sales2, aes(Good_category_new, Sales_amount_total/1000000,fill = Host_category)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  facet_wrap(~Name, nrow=4)+
  ggtitle("Sales by hosts and goods category")+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  theme(legend.position = "top")+
  xlab("Goods Category")+
  ylab("Total Sales (in millions CNY)")

sales2%>%
ggplot(aes( Good_category_new, Sales_amount_total/1000000, fill= Host_category)) +
geom_col(position = "dodge")+
scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
ggtitle("Sales by goods category")+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
xlab("Goods Category")+
ylab("Total Sales (in millions CNY)")
```

The above graph gives an overview of the product mix for each host among 7 main categories ordered by total revenue. It can be seen that celebrities sold products across most categories and almost all of they sold most in beauty (again, Luo Yonghao is an outlier). KOLs, on the other hand, generated most revenue from 1-3 categories that they had a close relationship with. Let's zoom in and look at each group with details. 


```{r}
#K is generally good at 1 or 2 categories according to their expertise. 
sales2%>%
filter(Host_category=='K')%>%
  ggplot(aes(Good_category_new, Sales_amount_total/1000000)) + 
  geom_col(fill = 'red') + 
  facet_wrap(~Name, nrow=2)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  ggtitle("Product mix for each KOL host among categories, ordered by total revenue")+
  xlab("Goods Category")+
  ylab("Total Sales (in millions CNY)")
```

From the graph, we can see Mr.Dong made most money from selling jewelries because he owned the jewerly shop. Zi An, Qiu Yingying and Lovemimius all made most sales in clothing and they also had their own online stores selling clothes. For four of them, they mainly promoted their own products. And viewers in their room should have the expectation about what they were watching and potentially buying Or in the other words, people who came to their rooms should already have a potential interest in the goods. Other KOLs are selling multiple categories of goods and a majority of them did become famous because of short videos and in that sense, they are more like online-celebrities. 

```{r}
#beauty is the most popular category in celebrities. Other categories is pretty even 
sales2%>%
filter(Host_category=='C')%>%
  ggplot(aes(Good_category_new,Sales_amount_total/1000000)) + 
  geom_col(fill = 'blue') + 
  facet_wrap(~Name, nrow=2)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  ggtitle("Product mix for each celebrities host among categories, ordered by total revenue")+
  xlab("Goods Category")+
  ylab("Total Sales (in millions CNY)")
```

The product mix for celebrities are quite different. Besides Luo Yonghao, most celebrities sold all kinds of good with a higher percentage in beauty. This is not hard to understand after thinking through it. E-commerce is not the major income source for celebrities and they don't usually sign an exclusive agreement with any companies. Therefore, we usually sold whatever goods found by their assistance either with high commission or high discount (so they would attract more people and increase their population). The fact that celebrities didn't specialize in one category attracts = people with different interests and again diversified what they sell. Another interesting fact is that the most popular category among celebrities is beauty. We think it is due to two reasons. Firstly, beauty is the most popular e-commerce categories overall. Unlike clothes, people don't need to try on before buying, which makes it easier for e-commerce. Also, beauty products usually have more discounts online and their price elasticity is high (not necessities as household) so lowering the price would trigger more sales. On the other hand, celebrities usually have good-lookings. Therefore, they are more convincing when promoting a beauty product. 

### Insights and findings

Overall, it agrees with our hypothesis that consumers came to KOL because they have expertise in a specific category and came to celebrities because of their reputation.

  ggtitle("repost versus revenue")+
  geom_smooth(method="lm", se= FALSE, formula = 'y ~ x')+
facet_grid(~ Host_category)
```

If we have a look at the relationship between the number of like, comments, and repost of the videos posted by each host and the daily revenues of live streams conducted by different hosts, we find that there’s a positive correlation of average revenue to the average likes and comments received by each host’s video. However, this relationship exist only for the celebrities. For the KOL, there’s almost no correlation between their average daily revenue to the average likes and comments for their video. One thing that we also notice is that the average number of repost received by the videos is also uncorrelated to the number of revenue generated by each hosts, no matter these hosts are celebrities or KOL. This could be partly explained by the following image, where we created a scatter plot for the number of like, comments and reposts received by all of the video in our data. 

```{r}
pairs(video_data[,6:8]/1000)
title(main = "Scatter plot for like, comments and reposts received by videols", xlab = "in thousands", ylab = "in thousands")
```

While the number of likes is highly correlated by the number of comments. The number of reposts appear to be not correlated with either comments or likes. Thus, we conclude while people exhibit the same pattern for liking or commenting a douyin video, they exhibit a different pattern for reposting a video, and this different pattern is less related to whether people would actually shop when the poster of these video conduct a live stream. 

### Relationship of average number of likes and comments versus some other statistic of each session of live streams

To further investigate why the number of likes and comments are correlated to the daily revenue for celebrities. We explored the relationship of average number of likes and comments versus some other statistic of each session of live streams, including the number of viewers, the number of gifts received, the number of new fans, etc. Here we found that the average number of likes and comments of a host is also correlated to the number of viewers entering a live stream conducted by this host. Compared to the daily revenue, the average number of viewer is more strongly correlated to the number of likes and comments. We also notice that this relationship is much stronger for celebrities compared to KOL.

### Insights and findings

Thus, we conclude that whether they are a lot of people likes or comments on a hosts’ videos may direct influence the number of viewers of each live stream of the hosts, because people who like or comment on a host’s video would probably lead to people’s further action of going into the host’s live stream room and check out what the host is selling. However, for celebrities, this action of going into hosts’ room would more likely result in people actually buying stuff, while this is not the same for KOLs.

### Difference between Weekdays and weenkends

Do people tend to buy more on weekdays, on weekends, or there is no difference?

```{r}
data_clean <- subset(data_clean,Se/60>=5)
data_clean$weekday <- weekdays(as.POSIXct(data_clean$Start_time), abbreviate = T)
data_clean$re <- data_clean$Total_sales_amount
data_clean$weekday <-factor(data_clean$weekday,levels=c("Mon","Tue","Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun"))
data_clean$weekends <- ifelse(data_clean$weekday%in%c("Sat","Sun"),"Weekends","Weekdays")
ggplot(data_clean,aes(weekday,re/1000000))+
  geom_violin(fill="steelblue",scale="count")+
  stat_summary(re =mean, geom="point", size=2, color="red")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(y="Total Sales Amount (Millions CNY)")

```


To gain insights on the relationship of purchasing power to the day of the week, we visualize the total sales amount (Revenue) by each day in the week through a violin plot. To make sure that only the valid live streaming counts in our analysis, we will only include those live streaming last longer than 5 minutes so that the NA values can be eliminated. The plot tells us not only the mean, which is denoted by the red dot but also the distribution of the total sales amount for each day’s live streaming. For all 7 days, most of the sales are clustered in the bottom, while a small number of large values are pulling the mean up. 

As this plot shows, the difference of the seven days in a week in terms of their distribution is not very obvious, as their distribution is similar. But we can still see that Thursday and Monday appear to have lower means compared to the other 5 days. This observation logically makes sense and might be related to consumer behavior in a week, as these two days are the most stressful during a workweek respectively. In general, people like to think of weekends as a time of rest and rejuvenation, and therefore people’s moods are typically at their lowest on Mondays and focus on the transition from relaxation to the new work or school week, which causes them to spend less time and money in watching live streaming. On the other hand, Thursday is the day right before Friday, the end of the work or school week, “the end of the week” feeling pushes people to be stressed and to focus more on their work or study, which might reduce their chance to watch live streaming and accordingly decrease the sales amount. Therefore, in general, selling on Monday and Thursday might be more challenging to generate higher revenue.

```{r}
ggplot(data_clean,aes(weekends,re/1000000))+
  geom_violin(fill="steelblue",scale = "width")+
  theme_bw()+
  stat_summary(re =mean, geom="point", size=2, color="red")+
  labs(y="Total Sales Amount (Millions CNY)")
```


The distribution of sales by the two groups of weekdays and weekends reveals that live streaming sales on weekends are more likely to generate a higher sales amount than those on weekdays. Live streaming sales on weekends also have a higher mean than those on weekdays. These observations suggest that selling on weekends is more likely to increase sales amount, which is in line with our intuition.



### Starting time

Does the start time of live streaming affect the sales amount?

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
data_clean$hour <- hour(data_clean$Start_time)
hour_avg <- aggregate(re~hour,data_clean,mean)
ggplot(hour_avg,aes(hour,re/1000000,group=1))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(col="red")+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Starting Time (Hour)",y="Average Total Sales Amount by Hour (Millions CNY)")
```

We plot the average total sales amounts in each hour (in millions of CNY) to the start of the time of live streaming, and find those live-streaming started at 10 AM tends to generate a much higher average total sales amount. Those live streaming started at 10 AM appear to be able to achieve an average total sales amount more than 2 times higher than those live-streaming started in the afternoon. This observation suggests that live streaming starting around 10 AM might be the best choice to improve the average total sales amount.


Does the start time of live streaming be related to duration?

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data_clean,aes(hour,Se/3600))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_bw()+
   geom_smooth(se=F)+
  labs(x="Starting Time (Hour)",y="Duration (hour)")
```


We plot the duration of live streaming to the starting time, and we find those live streaming started around 10 AM tends to have a longer live streaming duration. The smooth curve also indicates the same information that the live streaming started around 10 AM has the peaked duration, and after 10 AM, the duration decreases by time. In addition, the smooth curve shows a similar pattern as the plot of average total sales amounts in each hour (in millions of CNY) to the start of the time of live streaming, which indicates live streaming duration is positively related to the average total sales amounts in each hour.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data_clean,aes(Se/3600,re/(Se/3600)/1000000))+
  geom_point(col="steelblue")+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",se=F,col="black")+
  theme_bw()+
   labs(x="Duration (hour)",y="Average Sale Amount by hour (Millions CNY)")
```


This plot reaffirms that live streaming duration is positively related to the average total sales amounts in each hour.


```{r}
ggplot(data_clean,aes(Se/3600,re/(Se/3600)/1000000))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",se=F)+
  facet_wrap(~Host_category)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Duration (hour)",y="Average Sale Amount by hour (Millions CNY)")
```


Then we analyze the plot of average Sale Amount by hours to duration facet by whether the host is a KOL or not. As the plot shows, the slope of KOL is much steeper, which indicates that the positive relationship between the average total sales amounts in each hour and duration appears to be more significant for KOLs than the non-KOLs.


### The relationship between average stay length and sales amount
```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data_clean,aes(New_LS,re/1000000))+
  geom_point(col="steelblue")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5,lwd=0.8)+
  geom_smooth(se=F,col="red")+
  facet_wrap(~Host_category)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Stay time (min)",y="Total Sales Amount (Millions CNY)")
```

When analyzing a viewer’s average stay length in a host’s live streaming, we find an average stay time of 2.5 minutes appear to be the best choice, at which the total sales amount tends to be the highest, no matter the host is a KOL or not. Also, the stay time of KOL’s streaming room scattered more dispersed than that of non-KOLs, ranging from 1 to 8 minutes. On the other hand, the data points of non-KOLs are more clustered, and most of them are less than 3 minutes.

### Insights and findings

Based on the observations above, we can sum up that no matter the host is a KOL or not, an average stay time of 2.5 minutes in the live streaming room appears to be the best choice to boost the sales amount. Also, live streaming started around 10 AM tends to have a longer live streaming duration, and they also tend to generate a higher average total sales amounts than those started at other hours. In addition, selling on weekends is more likely to increase sales amount, whereas Monday and Thursday might be less favorable choices.
